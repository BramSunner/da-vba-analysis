DATA_PT_EAST_APRIL Module 2 Challenge.

# About the Project

This is a VBA script for excel that looks through daily stock data on a sheet.
From the daily data, it gives a quarterly summary including the stock ticker, quarterly change, percent change, and total volume traded.
From the quarterly summary, it finds the greatest percent change and greatest percent decrease as well as the highest volume traded and their associated stock ticker.
